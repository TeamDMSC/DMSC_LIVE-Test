    			<h1>What is #DMSC?</h1>
    			<p>#DMSC (Depriving Myself of Sleep for Charity) is a Non-Profit organisation founded to fundraise for War Child through gaming marathons. Oh, and we were born from the bedroom of your average teenager.</p><p>Not kidding. I'm serious when I'm typing this. It was something to do as I was completely bored (Hence why Depriving Myself of Sleep for Charity). Originally it was a 24 hour gaming marathon. Planned in the space of about 4 hours. But a couple months later (in December 2012) we started a 48 hour event. Yeah - one long event. We managed to raise &pound;217.99. Tons of cash right? Yep. I was elated - We raised a ton.
    			</p>
<p>We then planned a 13 hour LAN (Because it was something new and we didn't want to delve into it too fast) and raised &pound;96, less but it was a shorter event.</p>
<p>Last year wasn't our best year, but we are making sure that 2014 is going to be amazing! We planned something big but however due to other requirements I had on it couldn't be realised - But regardless, of that, it has been sent off to the legend that is Alice Jennings, who will be running it for us in the USA. Use the donation link to the side to donate, and be generous. It helps everyone out in the end!</p>

    			<h1>Who are War Child?</h1>
    		    <p><b>They look forward to a world in which children's lives aren't torn apart by war.</b></p>
                <p>Their whole team consists of 29 of them in an office in north London.</p>
                <p>They're trying to change the world.</p>
                <p>You could say they're a small charity with big ambitions.</p>
                <p>They're directly transforming the lives of tens of thousands of children. And we're campaigning to improve the lives of millions more.</p>
                <p>They've delivered <a href="http://www.warchild.org.uk/features/from-child-soldier-to-global-campaigner" target="_blank">our message to Prime Ministers</a>, and received <a href="http://www.warchild.org.uk/music/special-recognition-brit-award" target="_blank">BRIT awards</a> for our iconic music projects.</p>
                <p>Imagine what they could achieve with your help.</p>

    			<h1>How do they help?</h1>
    		    <P>They help to get children out of army uniforms and into school ones.</p>
                <p>War Child has worked with former child soldiers in Africa for many years. In Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) they're currently helping to reintegrate former child soldiers back into society and into education.</p>
                <p>Many child soldiers go through formal Demobilisation, Disarmament and Reintegration (DDR) programmes when they are free from the armed groups. These programmes tend to focus on the needs of boys but aren't always so sensitive to the specific needs of girls. As a result, girls are often a very vulnerable and marginalised group even among children who are already excluded and rejected by society.</p>
                <p>They're providing vital education, counselling and health services for girls - and helping to tackle the huge stigma associated with being a girl soldier. Whilst boys are considered to be dangerous and violent, girls are often seen as 'damaged goods' by their community and family. This is especially true if they have suffered a sexual assault or have given birth to a baby.</p>
